    "  * [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) build on top of JavaScript Vega library.\n",
    "3. packages build around OpenGL (or Vulcan) and WebGL (like [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/)) which offer speed at the price of complexity (usefull in high load applications: real-time 3D image rendering (games, medical imaging, ...).

    "Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh exposes two interface levels to users:\n",
    "* bokeh.models: A low-level interface that provides the most flexibility to application developers.\n",
    "* bokeh.plotting: A higher-level interface centered around composing visual glyphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't want to go too deep into the specifics, but it pays to have a rough understanding of the **components** and lingo of Bokeh.<br>\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">application</span>: a Bokeh application is a recipe for generating Bokeh documents. Typically this is Python code **run by a Bokeh server** when new sessions are created. The Bokeh server, open a whole new world of interactive dashboards, but is out of scope her.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">BokehJS</span>: the JavaScript client library that actually renders the visuals and handles the UI interactions for Bokeh plots and widgets in the browser. Typically, users will not have to think about this aspect of Bokeh much (“We write the JavaScript, so you don’t have to!”) but it is good to have basic knowledge of this dichotomy.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">documents</span>: organizing data structure for Bokeh applications. Documents contain all the Bokeh Models and data needed to render an interactive visualization or application in the browser.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">embedding</span>: various methods of including Bokeh plots and widgets into web apps and pages, or the IPython notebook. \n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">glyphs</span>: the basic visual building blocks of Bokeh plots, e.g. lines, rectangles, squares, wedges, patches, etc. The bokeh.plotting interface provides a convenient way to create plots centered around glyphs.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">models</span>: lowest-level objects that comprise Bokeh “scenegraphs”. Most users will not use this level of interface to assemble plots directly. However, ultimately all Bokeh plots consist of collections of models, so it is important to understand them enough to configure their attributes and properties.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">server</span>: the Bokeh server is an optional component that can be used for sharing and publishing Bokeh plots and apps, for handling streaming of large data sets, or for enabling sophisticated user interactions based off of widgets and selections.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue;font-weight:bold\">widgets</span>: user interface elements outside of a Bokeh plot such as sliders, drop down menus, buttons, etc. Events and updates from widgets can inform additional computations, or cause Bokeh plots to update.\n",
